The Tableau data visualization aims at finding the top artist by country and determines various characteristics of music like energy vs danceability and time series analysis of acoustics and valence

 1. The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle's spotify_dataset and is refreshed daily with a snapshot of the previous day's top 50 songs by country. Please find the data dictionary
